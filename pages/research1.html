                                Millets, among the earliest foods known to humanity, have been discovered in charred
                                grain form at Harappan sites and
                                are mentioned in the Vedas, ancient archaeological and literary sources of the Indian
                                subcontinent. Scientifically
                                categorized as small-seeded cereal grains within the grass family (Poaceae), millets
                                exhibit diverse species, colors,
                                and appearances, cultivated in numerous countries worldwide.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They fall into two main categories based on size: major millets (e.g., sorghum, pearl
                                millet, finger millet) and minor
                                millets (e.g., little millet, foxtail millet, proso millet, barnyard millet, kodo
                                millet).
                            </li>
                            <li>These ancient grains have served various purposes, being consumed by humans and utilized
                                as animal feed throughout
                                history. Millets are important staple food, particularly, in poor, semi-arid tropics of
                                Asia and Africa (Mahendra 2012
                                and Narloch et al., 2009) which are mostly cultivated under a variety of agro-ecological
                                situations like plains, coast
                                hills even diverse soil land varying rainfall.

                                They are most popular in developing regions, like India and Africa, where food and
                                nutritional security are the major challenges. Millets are one of the most drought
                                resistant crops and have immense production potential with minimal inputs.
                            </li>

                                According to FAOSTAT data from 2023, global millet production during 2019-2020 was 84.17
                                million metric tons, grown
                                across 70.75 million hectares of land. India contributed 20.50 percent of this
                                production.

                                Processing of millets improves its nutritional availability and digestibility. Malting
                                is such biological process which
                                improves the overall acceptability of millets. Malting leads to the production of
                                various hydrolytic enzymes and
                                bioactive compounds. It is a controlled technique involving the partial germination of
                                cereal grains (Banusha &
                                Vasantharuba, 2013). During malting, grains are hydrated under controlled conditions,
                                triggering the activation of
                                endogenous enzymes that transform the grain's constituents, such as soluble sugars,
                                proteins, and enzyme activity
                                (Nadeem et al., 2010).

                                This process enhances the nutritional content and digestibility of grains, making it a
                                simple method to increase iron
                                and other mineral availability from grains. Local crops like finger millet and moong
                                bean are commonly used for malting
                                (Platel et al., 2010). Research has shown that germination significantly increases the
                                protein content and nutritional
                                profile of grains.

                                        of grains by increasing the availability of vitamins (especially B vitamins),
